# **Equithon 2018 Hackenger Hunt**

This hackenger hunt was created for Equithon 2018, Waterloo's social innovation hackathon. The event was held in STC/QNC and hosted over 400 guests.  


The answers to the clues are as follows.  


## **Clue 1: A Gentle Start**  
Mike Lazaridis was a co-founder of Blackberry and donated to help build QNC, so the answer was *mikeblackberry*.  

## **Clue 2: DivARRsity**  
There was a hint in the name of the clue! Facebook provides a language option for 'English (Pirate)', which was what you had to set the language to (I guess it's only appropriate seeing as Facebook is being accused of stealing people's data like a true pirate steals from other ships). The events page and therefore the answer was *grogfests*.  

## **Clue 3: Puzzling Poems**  
This one was a physical clue. You had to figure out that the place to go for a 'brew' (coffee) was the Starbucks on the first floor of STC, and find the QR code taped on the sign. Once you scanned it, you would have found that the code was *99c8b25b9b83x0mm*.  

## **Clue 4: Don't get STUCK ON this one**  
Ironically, a lot of groups did get stuck on this one; you had to realize that only certain words were colored the same non-black color, and they spelled out 'Check bulletin board at'. The bolded words told you to go to the end of this page, where you would find coordinates for the bulletin board in the science building attached to STC. There was a piece of paper pinned to the board that said the answer was *social3quity*.  

## **Clue 5: A tree-cky one**  
There were a number of steps to this one. First, you had to figure out the numbers corresponding to the letter variables:  
a: *42* was the answer to life, the universe, and everything (from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy).  
b: there are *100* zeroes in the number googol (the origin of Google).  
c: the first three digit narcissistic number is *153* (this was an oversight on my part, i meant to bold 'three digit narcissistic number').  
d: converting to decimal from hex and roman numerals gives you *1080*.  
e: the bacon number (six degrees of separation, but with Kevin Bacon)  from Jennifer Lawrence to Michelle Obama is *2*.  


Next, players had to insert the numbers into a binary search tree (keeping in mind the order of insertion matters) and then correctly figure out that:  

next_clue = 882 + 'tree' = *882tree*  


## **Clue 6: f$#ked up beyond all recognition**
This clue, ignoring all the unnecessary reversal of letters, had you converting phrases and numbers from hexadecimal, binary, and base64. Once converted, the sentence asked you to count the number of cars and multiply it by the number of driveways on Equity Ct, Missisauga, ON (which was 8 * 11). There was also a red Rogers van parked on the road, so the final answer was *88rogers*. Google Street View was definitely useful here, unless any team actually travelled all the way to Missisauga and back (if so, please contact me you deserve a prize for effort).  


## **Winner!**  
Solving the last clue took you to a page asking you to find the organizer who created this (me!) and tell me all the clues to win.
